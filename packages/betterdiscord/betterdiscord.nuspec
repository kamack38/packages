## Themes

Themes allow you to completely customize your client with CSS. You can either make your own theme, or download the wide variety of themes from our community.

## Twitch Emotes

Use your favorite BTTV and FFZ emotes in discord chat with other BD users.

## Security

All plugin updates from our official repo are manually verified for malicious code.

## CSS Editor

BetterDiscord comes with a live CSS editor for debugging and basic UI tweaking.

## Developer Utils

Features for developers such as utility classes and a Plugin API come out of the box.

## Transparency

Enable transparency and use a transparent theme for a see-through window.

## Public Servers

Explore communities from [DiscordServers.com](https://discordservers.com/) directly through your client.
