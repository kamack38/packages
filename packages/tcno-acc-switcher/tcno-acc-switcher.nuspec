# TcNo Account Switcher

![Banner](https://rawcdn.githack.com/TcNobo/TcNo-Acc-Switcher/7490c2de7ff1e1a524c4357e9ba4b1e701b73ed8/other/img/Banner.png)

A Super fast account switcher for Steam, Battle.net, Epic Games, Origin, Riot Games and Ubisoft (and more soon) **Saves NO passwords or any user information**\*. Most switchers, including Steam work purely off changing a file and a few registry keys. Wastes no time closing, switching and restarting Steam and other platforms.
NOTE: Not created for cheating purposes. All it does is change accounts. Use it as you see fit, accepting responsibility.

## How does it work?

Simple. It swaps out files and registry values, pointing to your last logged in account while the program is closed. Think of it as freezing a platform like Steam in time, and replacing the "account block" with a previously frozen "account block", then unfreezing it. To Steam and your Steam account, it "looks" like you pulled your plug out and put it back in a week or so later, meanwhile you were playing on other accounts. Swapping the account block lets the program: Not interact with passwords, and not interact with 2-factor, so you can "Skip" both of those in the login process.
